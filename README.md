# Fake-News-Detection-System
Fake news is becoming a growing concern,  with the potential to affect public opinion and cause social  chaos. As a result, there is a crucial need to develop effective  fake news detection systems.
The goal of the research is to provide a tool that can assist users in making informed decisions about the news they consume and to improve overall trust in information by 
reducing the increase of fake news on online platforms. Using a hybrid strategy that combines knowledge-based reasoning with linguistic analysis in a seamless manner, this research looked at how these two different approaches may work together to overcome the flaws of current detection techniques.
We use the LeadingIndia.AI dataset [23] in our research, which is a component of the Newton Bhabha Fund program of the Royal Academy of Engineering, UK. The theme of this 
national initiative is "AI and deep learning Skilling and Research." The dataset contains all of the necessary information, such as the title of each news and its unique ID (id). The dataset specifically divides material into two groups: false news and legitimate news.
